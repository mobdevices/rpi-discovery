# rpi-discovery
A simple script that scans and discovers vulnerable raspberry pis' on the network or in given range of IPs. It checks for default password and open SSH connection and allows to pass any payloads to the target..

- The main program uses ssh to discover automatically and pass payloads on LAN Raspberry Pi's.
- The script is created for testing purposes with the idea to create a method to automate sshpass for command delivery to vulnerable Raspberry Pi's devices on the local network. Play with them and do whatever you want, since their owners left them with default password and SSH port open.
